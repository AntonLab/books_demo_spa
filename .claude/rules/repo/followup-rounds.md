# Follow-up fix rounds

A round that applies the follow-ups of a finished plan has no plan, only a
brief file. It runs the same chain as a plan task: `sdd-implementer`, then
`sdd-task-reviewer`, then `gate-runner`.

- **Review package without a plan:** pass the brief file where the plan goes,
  `bash scripts/sdd-step.sh review <brief.md> <BASE> [HEAD]`. It writes the
  diff under `.superpowers/sdd/<brief-name>/` and prints the path. Do not
  build the diff by hand. The brief lives in the main checkout (git-ignored)
  and the `*-followups.md` files in the task worktree: pass the brief by its
  absolute path, since a relative one fails with `no such plan file`.
- **Concerns land in the follow-ups file.** The brief's rule "do not edit the
  followups files" protects the lines being fixed. A `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` still
  gets its `accepted without user: <concern> -> <choice>` line, or goes to the
  user, under a `## Round <n>` heading in that file, as `pipeline.md` says. A
  concern left only in the chat is lost at `/clear`.
- **Baseline questions** ("does this warning also appear on `origin/dev`?"):
  `npm run baseline -- <client test path> [text]`. It builds a proper task
  worktree for the dev side; a bare `git worktree add` shares `shared` with the
  checkout it came from, so its result proves nothing.
- **Which lines to fix.** Offer "fix now" for a line with a real defect or a
  RED test. Recommend "drop" for a Minor line (naming, comment wording, a
  cosmetic merge): in the queue-b round seven such lines cost 18.46M tokens,
  37% of the chain.
- **Brief preamble for `sdd-implementer`.** Name the traps that cost calls:
  commit types are `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `ci` (no
  `perf:` or `wip:`); `.superpowers/` is git-ignored, so never `git add` the
  ledger; `sdd-step next` after the last task errors; `ls server/.env.local`
  hits a deny rule; write files with `Write`/`Edit`, since `cp`, `sed -i` and
  redirects are blocked.
- **`ui-checker`:** a follow-up round whose diff touches `client/src` is not
  checked again by default, since the plan's own run covered the behaviour.
  Ask the user, and run it when the round changed what a page shows or sends.
