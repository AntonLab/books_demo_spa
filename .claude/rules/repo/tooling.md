# Shared tooling

## `tsconfig.base.json`

- Every package's `tsconfig.json` extends it by relative path.
- It sets `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` for all three packages: an index read is
  `T | undefined`, application code handles the miss, and only test files
  assert it away with `!`.
- Fire-and-forget: await a promise, or mark a deliberate one `void` with the
  reason beside it (`onFinish={(values) => void handleFinish(values)}`). The
  typed lint rules take no `eslint-disable`.
- `erasableSyntaxOnly` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` hold everywhere, because
  Node strips types from the server and `shared` (ADR-0006); the client keeps
  the same rules so code moves between packages unchanged.
- Left off on purpose: `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` and
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, each a hundred-odd edits for little caught.
- Keep `include`, `exclude` and `paths` out of it: TypeScript resolves them
  against the declaring file, so they would point at the repo root.

## `eslint.config.base.mjs`

- Exports `createConfig({ ignores, tsconfigRootDir }, ...packageConfigs)`,
  built with ESLint's `defineConfig`. Each package's own `eslint.config.mjs`
  calls it with `import.meta.dirname`, because ESLint does not search parent
  directories.
- The `**/*.{ts,tsx}` block turns on typed linting (`projectService`) for four
  rules: `no-floating-promises` (node:test's `test`/`describe`/`it`/`suite`
  exempt), `no-misused-promises`, `await-thenable` and
  `switch-exhaustiveness-check` (a `default:` does not cover a missing union
  member: write the `case`). JavaScript stays untyped. Growing this toward
  `recommendedTypeChecked` is a deliberate step, one measured rule at a time.
- `no-duplicate-imports` allows one `import type` line beside the value import
  from the same module, the repo's style.
- `no-console` and `no-non-null-assertion` are errors; test files
  (`*.spec.ts`, `*.test.ts(x)`, `*.testkit.ts`, `src/test/`) may write `!`.
- The client config adds the rules `client/CLAUDE.md` lists;
  `no-restricted-imports` takes one option set per file, so each level block
  repeats the rules above it.
- Plugins resolve by bare specifier because the root `package.json` declares
  them and npm hoists them.

## Root `package.json`

Owns the devDependencies every package needs. `fallow` is installed for
audits (`repo-auditor` uses it with the `fallow` skill).
`shared/src/wire.typetest.ts` pins `Wire<T>` with type-level assertions that
`typecheck` checks.

## Pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`)

- Runs ESLint `--fix` per package, from inside it (flat config does not
  cascade, and that is what points typed linting at the package's tsconfig),
  routed by the staged path's `client/`, `server/` or `shared/` prefix. Then
  Prettier `--write` once from the root over every staged file. Re-stages what
  they rewrote; blocks on a surviving ESLint error; warnings pass.
- Refuses a partially staged file, since re-staging the rewritten copy would
  pull its unstaged hunks into the commit.
- If `node_modules/.bin` is missing it warns and lets the commit through.
- `core.hooksPath` is per-clone; the root `prepare` script sets it
  (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks` by hand).

## Commit-msg hook (`.githooks/commit-msg`)

Checks the subject against `^(feat|fix|refactor|chore|docs|test|ci)(\(scope\))?!?: `,
the types the root CLAUDE.md lists; add a type to both at once. Git's own
`Merge …` and `Revert "…"` subjects and `fixup!`/`squash!`/`amend!` pass.

## `.npmrc`

`engine-strict=true`: npm refuses to install on a Node below `engines.node`.

## `scripts/`

Plain Node (`*.mjs`) and one Bash script, with no dependencies; Prettier
checks the `.mjs` files, but no package's ESLint config reaches them.
`sdd-step.sh` finds the superpowers scripts by globbing the plugin cache for
the newest version, so it needs no update when the plugin does.
`plan-check.mjs` tells a test block from implementation by a `test`/`it`/
`describe`/`expect` call; a plan whose tests use another runner's names needs
the pattern widened, not the 15-line limit. It also caps a task at
`MAX_TASK_LINES` (180); a longer task becomes two.
