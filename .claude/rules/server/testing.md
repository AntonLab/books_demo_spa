# Server tests

## Layers

Each answers a question the others cannot:

- **Unit specs** run a module against doubles. Capture log output with
  `t.mock.method(logger, level, …)`. `errorHandler.spec.ts` pins the redaction
  rules: a parse failure's body is never echoed or logged, a 500 logs only
  name/message/stack.
- **Repository specs** run on MySQL and are the only place domain rules are
  proven (Draft visibility, the last Co-author, credits, Notifications, reorder
  409s, tombstones, rank, Cover/Avatar cascade).
- **Route specs** run `createApp` on in-memory fakes
  (`repositories/<name>Repository.fake.testkit.ts`) and assert the HTTP mapping
  and permission checks. A fake takes its seeds and spies as one options
  object and never grows a domain rule. Session, reset and notification fakes
  stay inline in their route specs. Shared harness:
  `routes/routeTestKit.testkit.ts`.
- **Contracts** (`<name>Repository.contract.testkit.ts`) run twice, on MySQL
  from `<name>Repository.spec.ts` and on the fake from `.fake.spec.ts`. They
  assert interface semantics only: `null`/`false` for a missing row, which
  error and which resource a `NotFoundError` names, an order a controller
  relies on. The one domain rule in a contract is a Genre name's
  case-insensitive uniqueness, because the fake has to reproduce what MySQL
  gets from the collation. A repository method a controller comes to rely on
  belongs in its contract. `chapterRepository.findBookCoAuthorIds` has no
  `ORDER BY`, so its contract compares a set.
- **`src/app.spec.ts`** is the one suite from HTTP through real repositories to
  MySQL, on its own `_app` schema. It takes its repositories from
  `createSequelizeRepositories()` as `index.ts` does, but repeats the boot
  steps around them (`initModels`, `sync`, `syncPermissions`), so a change to
  those needs the same change there. Its admin comes from `User.create`, since
  no API makes one.

## MySQL-backed suites

- Each asks `skipWithoutMysql()` (`db/mysqlProbe.testkit.ts`) whether to run:
  with `DB_USER` unset or MySQL unreachable it throws, failing the spec file
  with the reason. `SKIP_MYSQL=1` turns that failure into a skip, and makes
  `posttest` skip its cleanup. A new suite takes its `skip` from this helper,
  or a missing database passes it silently.
- `node:test` runs spec files in parallel processes, and two suites calling
  `sync({ force: true })` on one schema drop each other's tables. So each suite
  has its own schema, named `TEST_DB_NAME` (default `books_demo_spa_test`) plus
  `_<suite>`. `posttest` (`db/dropTestDatabases.testkit.ts`) drops everything
  under that prefix after a green run; a red run leaves the rows for
  inspection. A schema named any other way stays on disk forever.
- A suite that syncs calls `initModels`, not a single `init*Model`, or `sync`
  cannot work out the drop order.
- MySQL will not `TRUNCATE` a referenced table, so suites clear with
  `destroy({ where: {} })`, children first: `Like` → `Comment` → `Chapter` →
  `Book` → `Series` → `User`. `Comment` goes explicitly and before `User`,
  because `comments.userId` is `SET NULL` and would leave orphans. A suite that
  counts notifications clears `Notification` first.
- Create works through `createCreditedBook` / `createCreditedSeries`
  (`models/creditedBook.testkit.ts`), which write the credits beside them. A
  book is `in_progress` unless the fixture names a status, because a draft
  would hide the rows most suites read back.
